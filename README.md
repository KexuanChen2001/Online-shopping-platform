# Online-shopping-platform
My team members and I built a platform for online shopping in DBMS course. We used MySQL and XAMPP to design and analyze the shoe store database. We created an ER diagram that included at least 8 entities and 6 relationships. More than 50,000 records were generated for each database, including data that were both randomly generated and scraped. We then programmed the website using PHP and JavaScript. Buyers could set up accounts with a password, nickname, email, etc., view the shoe shop, add favorite shoe products to their collection database, and leave comments for purchased items. Sellers could also register a personal profile and manage their shoe database, including details like shoe ID, size, and price. When a buyer purchases shoes, the system automatically generates a shopping list, recording the time of purchase and the order number, while the seller's database deducts the shoes and displays the information in the sales info. My main responsibilities included constructing all databases and providing functionalities for buyers such as adding to collection, adding comments, making reservations, checking comments, generating shopping orders, and linking the front and back end of the database.

## DBMS (Database Management Systems)
In my Database Management Systems course, I studied various topics including the relational model, SQL, the Entity-Relationship (ER) model, and database design. We designed and implemented a database and web pages for an online shoe shopping platform.
